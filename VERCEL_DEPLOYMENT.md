# Deploying Hand Sign Detector to Vercel

## Quick Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Vercel account (free)
- Neon database (already configured via integration)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure your code is pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Import to Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Click **"Import Project"**
3. Select **"Import Git Repository"**
4. Choose your GitHub repository
5. Click **"Import"**

#### 3. Configure Build Settings

Vercel should auto-detect the settings, but verify:

- **Framework Preset:** Other
- **Build Command:** (leave empty for Flask)
- **Output Directory:** (leave empty)
- **Install Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Click **"Deploy"** - this first deployment will fail with "Database not configured" - that's expected!

#### 4. Add Environment Variables (Critical Step!)

After the first deployment:

1. In your Vercel project, click **"Settings"**
2. Click **"Environment Variables"** in the sidebar
3. Add the following variables:

**Required Variables:**

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
SECRET_KEY=any-random-secret-string
```

**How to get Neon DATABASE_URL:**
- Option 1: Already set via Neon integration (check Environment Variables)
- Option 2: Get manually from https://console.neon.tech
  - Select your project
  - Go to **Dashboard**
  - Copy the connection string from "Connection Details"
  - Use the **pooled connection** string

**Optional Variables (for AI Vision detection):**

```
AI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
AI_PROVIDER=openai
```

**Important:** For each variable, select all three environments:
- ✓ Production
- ✓ Preview  
- ✓ Development

#### 5. Redeploy

After adding environment variables:

1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Find the latest deployment
3. Click the **"..."** menu button
4. Select **"Redeploy"**
5. **Uncheck** "Use existing Build Cache"
6. Click **"Redeploy"**

Wait 1-2 minutes for the deployment to complete.

#### 6. Verify Deployment

1. Visit your deployed URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
2. The "Database not configured" error should be gone
3. Try creating a new account
4. Test logging in
5. Test the hand sign detection features

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Database not configured"

**Problem:** Environment variables are not set or not loaded

**Solutions:**
1. Verify DATABASE_URL is added in Settings → Environment Variables
2. Make sure you clicked "Save" for the variable
3. Redeploy the app (changes only apply after redeployment)
4. Check that you selected all three environments (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Verify DATABASE_URL includes `?sslmode=require` at the end

### Error: "Build failed"

**Problem:** Dependencies not installing correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Check that `requirements.txt` is in your repository
2. Verify all dependencies are listed
3. Check the build logs for specific errors
4. Try redeploying with build cache disabled

### Login works locally but not on Vercel

**Problem:** Different database or environment variables

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure the DATABASE_URL on Vercel matches your local `.env` file
2. Verify you're using the same Neon project
3. Check that users exist in the Neon database you're connecting to
4. Run a test query in Neon's SQL Editor to verify the users table has data

### Training data not syncing across devices

**Problem:** Cloud storage not working

**Solutions:**
1. Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
2. Check that the `training_data` table exists in your Neon database
3. Check Vercel deployment logs for database errors

### AI Detection not working on Vercel

**Problem:** Missing AI API credentials

**Solutions:**
1. Add `AI_API_KEY` environment variable with your OpenAI API key
2. Add `AI_PROVIDER=openai` environment variable
3. Redeploy the application
4. Alternatively, use the free KNN or Rule-Based detection methods

### Database connection timeouts

**Problem:** Connection pool exhausted or slow queries

**Solutions:**
1. Use the **pooled connection string** from Neon (not direct connection)
2. Check your Neon project isn't sleeping (free tier limitation)
3. Upgrade Neon plan if you have high traffic

## Updating Your Deployment

When you make changes to your code:

1. **Commit and push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your update message"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Automatic deployment:**
   - Vercel will automatically detect the push and redeploy
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for the new version to go live

3. **Manual deployment:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
   - Click "Redeploy" on any previous deployment

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Purpose | Required | Where to Get It |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon PostgreSQL connection | ✓ Yes | Neon Console → Dashboard → Connection Details |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask session encryption | ✓ Yes | Any random string you create |
| `AI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API for vision detection | Optional | https://platform.openai.com/api-keys |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | AI provider name | Optional | Set to `openai` |

---

## Neon Database Setup

Your Neon database should already have these tables created:
- `users` - User accounts
- `training_data` - Hand sign training data

If tables are missing, you can create them via:
1. Neon Console → SQL Editor
2. Run the SQL from `NEON_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files to Git** - They contain secrets
2. **Use connection pooling** - Always use Neon's pooled connection string
3. **Rotate keys periodically** - Update in Vercel dashboard when you do
4. **Use different Neon projects** for development and production
5. **Monitor database usage** - Check Neon console for query performance

---

## Support

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. Check the Vercel deployment logs in the "Deployments" tab
2. Check your Neon logs in the Neon Console
3. Verify environment variables are spelled correctly (case-sensitive!)
4. Try deploying to a new Vercel project to isolate the issue
5. Run local diagnostics: `python diagnose_and_fix.py`
